# Library Management System (LMS)

This project is a simple Library Management System (LMS) built using Python. The LMS helps in keeping records of books in a library and provides the following functionalities:
- **Display Books**: View the list of available books in the library.
- **Issue Books**: Borrow books from the library by providing the book ID.
- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library’s collection.
- **Return Books**: Return borrowed books to the library.

## Features
1. **Display Books**: Lists all the books with their ID, title, and availability status.
2. **Issue Books**: Allows a user to issue a book by providing their name and the book ID.
3. **Add Books**: Admins can add new books to the library by entering the book title.
4. **Return Books**: Users can return issued books by providing the book ID.

## How It Works
1. When you run the program, you will be prompted to choose an action by pressing a key:
   - `D` to Display Books
   - `I` to Issue Books
   - `A` to Add Books
   - `R` to Return Books
   - `Q` to Quit

2. Based on your selection, you will be able to interact with the library's records.

## File Structure
- **list_of_books.txt**: This file contains the initial list of books available in the library.
- **LMS Class**: This class contains methods to manage the library operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text file named `list_of_books.txt` containing the initial book list (each book title on a new line).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naren004/Libriary_Management_System
   
   ```
2. Ensure you have `list_of_books.txt` in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python lms.py
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Implement a user interface (UI) for better user interaction.
- Add user authentication for issuing and returning books.
- Track the number of copies available for each book.
